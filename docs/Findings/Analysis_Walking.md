# Human Walking as Physical Intelligence: A CGM-Based Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines human walking as geometric alignment under gravity using literature values from Herr & Popović (2008) and a CGM-inspired framework. The data support a non-zero coherent helical structure (|CHSI| ≈ 0.71; polarity negative under x=ML, y=AP, z=UP), first-order geometric margins relative to the base of support (AP ≈ 0.72; ML ≈ 0.92), an Action-per-Stride Index ≈ 4.15 S_min (3.7% from 4, consistent with discrete correction packets under our assumptions), and a Phase-Offset Score of 0.867 (24° from the 120° reference). Aggregated into a constructed Alignment Index (AIS), these yield AIS ≈ 0.81. "Horizon" and "thermodynamic" terms are used by analogy as variability/complexity proxies rather than literal thermodynamic quantities.

## 1. Introduction and Context

### 1.1 The Central Question

How does human walking relate to fundamental physics principles? This analysis bridges the Common Governance Model (CGM) - a theoretical framework describing reality's emergence through geometric alignment - with empirical walking biomechanics. The connection reveals that walking exemplifies "physical intelligence" as the capacity to maintain perpendicular alignment against gravity through efficient geometric corrections.

### 1.2 Theoretical Foundation: CGM

The Common Governance Model posits that reality emerges through four recursive stages:
- **Common Source (CS)**: Primordial left-handed chirality (α = π/2)
- **Unity Non-Absolute (UNA)**: Observable structure emerges (β = π/4)
- **Opposition Non-Absolute (ONA)**: Full differentiation (γ = π/4)
- **Balance Universal (BU)**: Closure with 2.07% aperture

Key CGM predictions include:
- Aperture parameter m_p = 0.199471 (2.07% openness)
- Complete solid angle Q_G = 4π steradians
- Energy duality ratio √3 = 1.732
- Minimal action quantum S_min = 0.3133

### 1.3 Biomechanical Foundation

Herr & Popović (2008) established that human walking maintains near-zero angular momentum through segmental cancellation. Key empirical findings:
- CMP-CenPen separation: 14% of foot length (steady), 50% (maneuvers)
- Zero-moment model R²: 0.91 (ML), 0.90 (AP)
- Segmental cancellation: 95% (ML), 70% (AP), 80% (V)
- Principal components: 3 PCs explain >90% variance

Recent studies (2020-2025) confirm walking as continuous perpendicularity maintenance through COG-ZMP regulation, with measurable deviations predicting fall risk.

## 2. Methods and Approach

### 2.1 Analysis Framework

We developed a self-contained Python analysis connecting CGM constants to walking metrics without requiring external datasets. The analysis examines:

1. **Aperture Correspondence**: Relating CGM's 2.07% aperture to walking's 14% CMP-CenPen defect
2. **Chirality Analysis**: Computing helical structure from angular momentum distributions
3. **Perpendicularity Budget**: Quantifying safety margins from balance horizons
4. **Action Quantization**: Testing if walking uses discrete S_min units
5. **Phase Relationships**: Comparing limb coordination to 120° frustrated closure
6. **Energy Ratios**: Verifying √3 duality in work partitioning

### 2.2 Assumptions & Parameters

- **Foot length**: 0.25 m, **width**: 0.10 m
- **CMP-CenPen (steady)**: 0.14 × foot length; **ML projection factor**: 0.3
- **Mechanical efficiency**: 0.65; body mass not used directly in index results
- **PCs**: 3 (>90% variance)
- **Axis convention fixed**: x=ML, y=AP, z=UP
- **Phase metrics derived from**: stance 60%, swing 40%, DS 20%

### 2.3 Key Calculations

**Coherent Helical Structure Index (CHSI)**: Using fixed axis convention (x=ML, y=AP, z=UP):
```
helicity = (t × l) · n
helical_index = sign(helicity) × ortho_score × ds_score
```

**Perpendicularity Margins**: 
```
margin_AP = 1 - defect_AP/(foot_length/2)
margin_ML = 1 - defect_ML/(foot_width/2)
```

**Action Quantization**:
```
action_quanta = work_per_stride / S_min
quantization_error = |action_quanta - round(action_quanta)| / round(action_quanta)
```

**Alignment Intelligence Score** (bounded 0-1):
```
AIS = geometric_mean(|helical_index|, perp_margin, quant_quality, phase_coherence)
```

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Coherent Helical Structure

- **CHSI magnitude**: |CHSI| = 0.714
- **Polarity**: negative under x=ML, y=AP, z=UP convention
- **Orthogonality score**: 1.000 (perfect perpendicularity)
- **DS coherence**: 0.714

> *Convention note.* CHSI sign depends on axis ordering. We fix x=ML, y=AP, z=UP. Changing this order flips the sign but not |CHSI|. Interpret |CHSI| as the structural result.

The coherent helical structure in gait is quantified by CHSI, combining orthogonality and double-support timing. We obtain |CHSI| ≈ 0.71 with negative polarity under the x=ML, y=AP, z=UP convention. The significance is the **non-zero coherence**: a non-zero CHSI means angular momentum and timing are not random noise but organized into a structured, predictable pattern. This is an **information-bearing** property. Polarity flips with axis order; the substantive finding is the non-zero magnitude, indicating a non-isotropic, coherent chiral organization of gait dynamics rather than isotropic cancellation.

### 3.2 Geometric Base of Support Margins

- **Geometric BOS margin (AP)**: ≈ 0.72
- **Geometric BOS margin (ML)**: ≈ 0.92
- **Overall margin**: 0.72

Using foot length 0.25 m, width 0.10 m, CMP-CenPen = 0.14×foot length, with a 0.3 ML projection factor (first-order bound, not a full stability metric). These margins quantify how much "space" the system has for corrective action before reaching a boundary. That's directly interpretable as **available information capacity for adaptation** — first-order information buffers that allow error signals to be meaningful rather than catastrophic.

### 3.3 Action-per-Stride Index

- **Action-per-Stride Index (ASI)**: ≈ 4.15 S_min
- **Nearest integer**: 4
- **Deviation from integer**: 3.7%
- **Status**: near-integer, consistent with discrete correction packets

> *Sensitivity.* ASI depends on assumed mechanical efficiency and S_min. Varying either by ±10% moves ASI by ≈±0.3.

The Action-per-Stride Index (ASI) is ASI = work per stride/S_min. With standard mechanical-efficiency assumptions, ASI ≈ 4.15 S_min (3.7% from 4). The near-integer result suggests control is implemented in discrete packets, rather than as unbroken continuous regulation. That is equivalent to **information discretisation**: packaging control into units for tractability. We interpret this not as literal quantum, but as evidence of **information quantisation** in motor control — discrete correction packets rather than continuous flow.

### 3.4 Phase Relationships

- **Effective limb offset**: 144° (with DS=20%)
- **CGM target**: 120° (frustrated closure)
- **Required DS for 120°**: 33.3%
- **Phase-Offset Score**: 0.867 (24° from 120° target; derived from stance/swing and 20% double support)

The 24° deviation from ideal frustrated closure represents biological optimization balancing stability and efficiency. The deviation itself can be framed as **informational flexibility**: the system does not lock into a rigid geometric optimum but operates near it, trading stability vs efficiency. Walking demonstrates adaptive phase alignment within geometric bounds, indicating flexible policy encoding. Phase-Offset Score is a normalized geometric deviation, not spectral coherence.

### 3.5 Energy Ratios

- **CGM √3**: 1.7321
- **At modelled 30° inverted-pendulum angle, PE/KE**: 1.7321
- **Empirical work ratio**: 1.700
- **Deviation**: 0.0321 (1.9%)

At a modelled 30° inverted-pendulum angle, PE/KE = √3; empirical work ratio ≈ 1.7 (1.9% from √3). This is consistent with energy duality principle operating at walking scale.

### 3.6 Horizon Thermodynamics (Mathematical Analogy)

> *Analogy notice.* "Horizon," "entropy," and "temperature" here are mathematical analogies mapping to variability/complexity measures in gait. They are not literal thermodynamic states. The identity m_p² Q_G = 0.5 is algebraic and serves only as an internal consistency check.

The walking support polygon boundary exhibits scaling analogous to black hole horizons:

- **Complexity proxy (by analogy)**: ×1.1995 (20% increase from minimal)
- **Variability proxy (by analogy)**: ×0.8337 (17% reduction from equilibrium)
- **Lifetime scaling**: ×2.0699 (107% increase in stability duration)
- **Horizon distance**: 86.0% of support polygon utilized
- **Info leakage rate**: 0.1663 (16.6% information loss per cycle)
- **Closure identity**: m_p²×Q_G = 0.5000 (holds by definition of m_p; serves as internal check, not external evidence)

These are analogical **information-boundary markers**. The "horizon" is where control information saturates — the edge of stability. This scaling suggests the support polygon edge functions as an **information horizon** (limits of meaningful corrective information), not physical thermodynamics, similar to how black hole horizons mark the boundary of information preservation.

### 3.7 Information Propagation Timescales

Walking operates on timescales consistent with CGM predictions:
- **CGM timescale**: 0.1995 s
- **Stride duration**: 1.2857 s
- **Policy update ratio**: 6.45 (stride time / τ_CGM)

The 6.45× ratio indicates multi-cycle separation of timescales (stride ≈ 6.45× τ_CGM). This ratio reflects **multi-scale information updating**: the nervous system doesn't update continuously, but in coherent multiples of an underlying timescale. That's structured temporal information management — **harmonic policy updates** where the nervous system operates at harmonics of a fundamental timescale, which is an information-structuring property.

### 3.8 Intelligence Metrics (Compression Analysis)

The nervous system achieves optimal information compression through principal component control:

- **Minimum description length**: 1.585 bits (log₂(3) for 3 PCs)
- **Maximum information capacity**: 2.585 bits (log₂(6) for 6 DoF)
- **Compression efficiency**: 0.613 (61.3% reduction)
- **Intelligence metric**: 0.293 (geometric mean of compression × aperture)
- **CGM theoretical optimum**: 0.316
- **Intelligence ratio**: 0.928 (92.8% of theoretical maximum)

This is the **clearest evidence of intelligence**: the nervous system reduces dimensionality, compressing redundant degrees of freedom into efficient control modes. That is canonical **information compression** — near-optimal lossy compression of control information, consistent with efficient intelligence.

### 3.9 Predictive Tests

**Beam Walking (3cm width)**:
- Required defect reduction: 0.429× 
- Allowable CMP-CenPen: 6.0% (from 14%)

**Aging Simulation (step width ×1.2)**:
- ML axis fraction increases: 0.714 → 0.783
- 4π allocation index drops: 0.429 → 0.326

### 3.10 Overall Alignment Intelligence

**AIS = 0.809 (constructed information-efficiency score for alignment)**

AIS is an **information-efficiency metric**: it combines structural coherence, buffer capacity, discretisation quality, and phase adaptability into a bounded index. This is a constructed information-efficiency score for alignment, not a physical measurement, but a way to summarise multi-faceted evidence of physical intelligence.

Components:
- Coherent helical structure: 0.714
- Information buffer capacity: 0.720
- Information discretisation quality: 0.963
- Phase-offset score: 0.867

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Physical Intelligence as Information Processing

The results demonstrate that walking exemplifies physical intelligence through **information processing** at the physical level. The non-zero coherent helical structure, information discretisation in corrections, and maintained information buffers demonstrate that intelligence means efficiently processing and organizing information to maintain upright posture against gravity through structured geometric operations.

### 4.2 Scale Relationships

The 14% walking defect is ~7× larger than CGM's 2.07% aperture. This scale difference is expected - biological systems require larger operational margins than fundamental physics. The key insight is that both operate through the same principle: maintaining closure with sufficient aperture for adaptation.

### 4.3 Information Discretisation in Motor Control

The ~4 S_min Action-per-Stride Index with only 3.7% error strongly suggests the nervous system packages corrections into discrete units. This represents **information discretisation** - rather than continuous optimization, the body executes standardized correction packets, making control tractable through information quantisation.

### 4.4 Coherent Structure as Information Organization

The non-zero coherent helical structure isn't arbitrary - it represents organized information processing that matches CGM's primordial chirality from the Common Source. This suggests biological systems inherit and express the same information-organizing bias present at reality's foundation.

### 4.5 Lossy Information Compression

Using only 3 principal components to capture >90% variance while maintaining 6 degrees of freedom represents 50% compression. This is **lossy information compression** - the most direct evidence of intelligence in the system. The nervous system achieves near-optimal compression of control information, allowing complex multi-segment dynamics to be controlled through simplified coordination patterns.

### 4.6 Information Horizons and Boundaries

The support polygon edge exhibits scaling analogous to black hole horizons, with 20% complexity increase and 17% variability reduction. This suggests the balance boundary functions as an **information horizon** where control information saturates — the edge of meaningful corrective information. The closure identity (m_p²×Q_G = 0.5000) serves as an internal consistency check for the geometric framework.

Here is a section you could add, written in the same voice and register as your analysis. The most natural place is in **Discussion → 4.6 Information Horizons and Boundaries**, because that is where you already treat the support polygon as a horizon analogue. The finger example extends the argument to a finer scale, so it belongs immediately after that.

### 4.6a Digits, Apertures, and Micro-Horizons

The aperture–horizon principle that governs walking is expressed through the structure of the feet. The five-toed foot is not a redundant evolutionary remnant but an instance of recursive closure. Four toes establish a lateral base and distribute support across the mediolateral axis, while the hallux functions as a directional anchor that determines forward progression. In human gait the hallux dominates the final push-off, contributing more than 80% of the propulsive ground reaction force, while the lateral toes provide stabilising corrections. This four-plus-one organisation reflects near-complete closure with a preserved aperture, where most of the digits support global stability and one asymmetric element channels directional flow.

Walking stability therefore arises from recursive alignment around a privileged aperture. The hallux enforces orientation and forward progression, while the lateral toes maintain limited corrective capacity that prevents collapse into rigid determinism. This structure exemplifies the balance between closure and openness identified in the CGM framework: 97.93 percent stability with 2.07 percent aperture. Alignment in gait is not the repetition of symmetric oscillations but the ordered interaction of digits that reconcile symmetry with asymmetry and stability with adaptability.

The same pattern appears in the hand at a different functional horizon. Four fingers form a stabilising manifold for grip, while the thumb supplies the asymmetry that allows opposition, manipulation and directional control. Each fingertip defines a micro-horizon where control is preserved inside the friction cone and tactile aperture but is lost beyond it. Manipulation typically recruits triads of thumb and two fingers whose force sharing resembles the 120° frustrated closure observed in gait. As in the foot, stability emerges from offset contributions balanced around a geometric reference rather than from rigid closure.

The wrist–digit chain also forms a coherent chiral structure. Pronation and supination, radial and ulnar deviation, and thumb opposition combine to produce a helical organisation. As in gait, the sign of this helicity depends on axis convention, but the non-zero magnitude reveals that manipulative patterns are structured and information-bearing rather than isotropic noise.

Hands and feet therefore represent complementary expressions of the same principle. The feet enforce parallel orientation for locomotor coherence, maximising directional stability while preserving apertures primarily as safety margins. The hands maximise local coverage around the thumb, maintaining micro-apertures for adaptive manipulation. Both are examples of near-closure for stability with a controlled aperture for adaptation, scaled to the requirements of progression in walking and dexterity in grasp.

### 4.7 Harmonic Policy Updates

The 6.45× ratio between stride time and CGM timescale indicates **harmonic policy updates** — the nervous system operates at harmonics of a fundamental timescale, which is an information-structuring property. This provides a temporal framework for discrete correction deployment through structured temporal information management.

## 5. Implications

### 5.1 For Biomechanics

- Walking can be understood as continuous geometric realignment
- The 14% CMP-CenPen defect represents an optimal aperture for human scale
- Phase relationships encode geometric constraints, not just timing

### 5.2 For Motor Control

- The nervous system operates through quantized correction units
- Left-handed bias in corrections may be universal, not learned
- Principal component control achieves optimal information compression

### 5.3 For Rehabilitation

- Beam walking prediction (14% → 6%) provides testable constraint
- Aging changes can be quantified through axis reallocation
- Alignment intelligence score could assess motor function

### 5.4 For Physics

- Macroscopic systems exhibit the same alignment principles as quantum scales
- Chirality persists across scales from fundamental to biological
- Aperture/closure balance is universal, with scale-dependent manifestation

## 6. Limitations and Caveats

### 6.1 Fixed Conventions

The helical index sign depends on axis ordering. We fixed the convention (x=ML, y=AP, z=UP) to ensure reproducibility. Different conventions would flip the sign but not change the magnitude or interpretation.

### 6.2 Literature Values

We used canonical values from Herr & Popović. Individual variations exist, but the structural relationships should persist across populations.

### 6.3 Analogical Reasoning

The horizon thermodynamics parallel is conceptual, not literal. Walking "horizons" (support polygon edges) share mathematical structure with black hole horizons but operate at vastly different scales.

### 6.4 Causation vs Correlation

While walking exhibits CGM-predicted patterns, this doesn't prove CGM causes walking mechanics. The relationship may reflect shared geometric constraints on any system maintaining dynamic stability.

## 7. Conclusions

This analysis examines human walking as geometric alignment under gravity using literature values and a CGM-inspired framework. The key findings:

**Empirically supported (from literature values)**:
1. **CMP-CenPen separation**: steady ≈ 14%, maneuvers ≈ 50%
2. **Segmental cancellation**: 95% (ML), 70% (AP), 80% (V)  
3. **Principal components**: ~3 PCs cover >90% variance
4. **Low net angular momentum**: |L| < 0.050 (normalized)

**Model-based calculations using those values**:
5. **Coherent helical structure**: |CHSI| ≈ 0.71 (under stated convention)
6. **Geometric BOS margins**: AP ≈ 0.72, ML ≈ 0.92
7. **Phase-offset score**: 0.867 (24° from 120° target)
8. **Action-per-stride index**: ≈ 4.15 S_min (3.7% from 4)

**Analogical/speculative extensions**:
9. **Horizon-style proxies**: Support polygon edges exhibit scaling analogous to black hole horizons
10. **CGM alignment parallels**: Consistent with discrete correction packets hypothesis
11. **Temporal coherence**: 6.45× CGM timescale ratio suggests harmonic policy updates

The AIS = 0.809 indicates a high relative score on this constructed information-efficiency index. This is consistent with the broader thesis that physical intelligence equals the capacity for **information processing** through measurable geometric operations maintaining perpendicularity via structured information organization.

Walking thus serves as an accessible window into how **information processing principles** manifest across scales, from quantum to biological, unified by the requirement for systems to maintain coherent information structure while preserving adaptive freedom.
