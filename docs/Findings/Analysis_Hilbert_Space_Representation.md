# Hilbert Space Representation of the Common Governance Model via GNS Construction

## Abstract

We construct an explicit Hilbert space representation of the Common Governance Model (CGM) using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction. The modal operators [L] and [R] are realized as unitary operators on a Hilbert space H, with the horizon constant Q_G = 4π serving as the normalization. The construction begins with a *-algebra generated by two abstract unitaries U_L and U_R, defines a positive linear functional ω encoding the horizon normalization and axiom constraints, and applies the GNS theorem to obtain (H_ω, π_ω, |Ω⟩) where U_L and U_R act as bounded unitary operators. We show that the absoluteness conditions (CS7: □B) correspond to projection operators on cyclic subspaces, and that observables correspond to self-adjoint operators with well-defined spectra. This provides the bridge from the abstract logical calculus to the standard quantum framework, establishing CGM's rigorous Hilbert space formulation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Representation Problem

The Common Governance Model establishes a formal deductive system with modal operators [L] and [R] satisfying axioms CS1–CS7. To connect this abstract system to quantum mechanics, we require:

1. A Hilbert space H (complete inner-product space)
2. Unitary operators implementing [L] and [R]
3. Self-adjoint observables corresponding to physical quantities
4. A normalization compatible with Q_G = 4π

The standard mathematical tool for this is the GNS construction, which produces a Hilbert space representation from any *-algebra with a positive linear functional.

### 1.2 Strategy

We construct:
- A *-algebra A generated by formal unitaries u_L, u_R
- A positive normalized linear functional ω on A encoding CGM constraints
- The GNS triple (H_ω, π_ω, |Ω⟩) yielding unitary operators U_L = π_ω(u_L), U_R = π_ω(u_R)
- Projection operators corresponding to absoluteness conditions
- Self-adjoint observables for the CGM metrics

## 2. The *-Algebra of Observables

### 2.1 Generator Definitions

Define the free *-algebra A generated by two symbols u_L and u_R with relations:

```
u_L u_L* = u_L* u_L = I
u_R u_R* = u_R* u_R = I
```

These encode that u_L and u_R are formal unitaries. We do not initially impose commutativity or any specific product relations between u_L and u_R.

### 2.2 Modal Operators as Algebra Elements

The modal operators correspond to:
- [L]: multiplication by u_L on the left
- [R]: multiplication by u_R on the left

Composite operators:
- [L][R]: multiplication by u_L u_R
- [R][L]: multiplication by u_R u_L
- [L][R][L][R]: multiplication by u_L u_R u_L u_R
- [R][L][R][L]: multiplication by u_R u_L u_R u_L

### 2.3 Horizon Constant

The horizon constant S is represented by the identity element I ∈ A, scaled by the normalization factor Q_G = 4π in the functional ω.

## 3. The State Functional ω

### 3.1 Normalization

Define ω: A → C as a positive linear functional with:

```
ω(I) = 1
```

The horizon constant normalization is encoded through:

```
ω(P_S) = Q_G/(4π) = 1
```

where P_S is the projection onto the horizon sector.

### 3.2 Encoding Axiom CS7 (Balance is Universal)

Axiom CS7 states □B, meaning the four-step compositions commute. We encode this as:

```
ω((u_L u_R u_L u_R - u_R u_L u_R u_L)* (u_L u_R u_L u_R - u_R u_L u_R u_L)) = 0
```

This means the difference between the two four-step orderings has zero expectation value in the GNS representation, implementing absoluteness of balance.

### 3.3 Encoding CS3 and CS5 (Non-Absoluteness at Depth Two)

CS3 states ¬□E (two-step equality is not absolute). We do not set u_L u_R = u_R u_L as an operator equality. Instead:

```
ω((u_L u_R - u_R u_L)* (u_L u_R - u_R u_L)) > 0
```

This ensures the two-step compositions differ in the representation, implementing non-absoluteness.

CS5 similarly prevents absolute inequality.

### 3.4 Chirality Encoding (CS1, CS2)

CS1 states [R]S ↔ S, meaning right transition preserves the horizon:

```
ω(u_R) = ω(I) = 1
```

CS2 states ¬([L]S ↔ S), meaning left transition alters the horizon:

```
ω(u_L) ≠ ω(I)
```

For concreteness, we can set ω(u_L) = e^(iθ_L) with θ_L ≠ 0, encoding the chiral phase.

## 4. GNS Construction

### 4.1 The GNS Theorem

**Theorem (GNS):** For any *-algebra A with a positive linear functional ω, there exists a triple (H_ω, π_ω, |Ω⟩) where:
- H_ω is a Hilbert space
- π_ω: A → B(H_ω) is a *-representation
- |Ω⟩ ∈ H_ω is a cyclic vector
- ω(a) = ⟨Ω|π_ω(a)|Ω⟩ for all a ∈ A

### 4.2 Application to CGM

Apply the GNS construction to (A, ω):

**Step 1:** Define the pre-Hilbert space as A/N where N = {a ∈ A : ω(a*a) = 0} is the null space.

**Step 2:** Define inner product on A/N by:
```
⟨[a], [b]⟩ = ω(a* b)
```

**Step 3:** Complete to obtain Hilbert space H_ω.

**Step 4:** The cyclic vector is |Ω⟩ = [I] (the equivalence class of the identity).

**Step 5:** The representation is:
```
π_ω(a)[b] = [ab]
```

### 4.3 Unitary Operators

The modal operators become unitary operators on H_ω:

```
U_L := π_ω(u_L)
U_R := π_ω(u_R)
```

These satisfy:
- U_L U_L† = U_L† U_L = I (unitarity)
- U_R U_R† = U_R† U_R = I (unitarity)
- ⟨Ω|U_L U_R U_L U_R|Ω⟩ = ⟨Ω|U_R U_L U_R U_L|Ω⟩ (CS7 encoded)

## 5. Concrete Model: L²(S², dΩ)

### 5.1 Sphere Representation

A concrete realization uses H = L²(S², dΩ) where:
- S² is the unit 2-sphere (representing the observable horizon)
- dΩ is the standard solid angle measure with ∫_{S²} dΩ = 4π

The normalization factor is precisely Q_G = 4π.

### 5.2 Rotation Operators

Let U_L and U_R act as rotation operators on S²:

```
(U_L f)(ω) = f(R_L^{-1} ω)
(U_R f)(ω) = f(R_R^{-1} ω)
```

where R_L and R_R are specific rotations in SO(3) encoding the left and right gyrations.

The normalized measure gives:

```
ω(f) = (1/4π) ∫_{S²} f(ω) dΩ
```

### 5.3 Verification

With this concrete model:
- H is complete (L² spaces are complete)
- U_L, U_R are unitary (rotation operators preserve the L² norm)
- The cyclic vector |Ω⟩ can be taken as the constant function
- ⟨Ω|Ω⟩ = 1 (normalized)

## 6. Observables as Self-Adjoint Operators

### 6.1 Projection Operators

Define projection operators corresponding to modal formulas:

**Unity projection:**
```
P_U = projection onto {ψ ∈ H : U_L ψ = U_R ψ}
```

**Balance projection:**
```
P_B = projection onto {ψ ∈ H : U_L U_R U_L U_R ψ = U_R U_L U_R U_L ψ}
```

These are self-adjoint by construction (projections are self-adjoint).

### 6.2 Absoluteness as Spectral Property

A formula φ is "absolute" (□φ holds) if and only if the corresponding projection P_φ satisfies:

```
U_L P_φ U_L† = P_φ  and  U_R P_φ U_R† = P_φ
```

This is the invariance condition under both transitions, realized as a spectral property of the projection.

### 6.3 CGM Metrics as Observables

The four CGM metrics correspond to self-adjoint operators:

**Traceability:** T = (U_R + U_R†)/2 (real part of right unitary)

**Variety:** V = I - P_U (complement of unity projection)

**Accountability:** A = I - P_O (complement of opposition projection)

**Integrity:** B = P_B (balance projection)

Each has real spectrum, making them legitimate observables.

## 7. Modal Depth and Operator Composition

### 7.1 Depth Hierarchy

The modal depth structure corresponds to operator composition:

**Depth one:** U_L, U_R (single operators)

**Depth two:** U_L U_R, U_R U_L (two-operator products)

**Depth four:** U_L U_R U_L U_R, U_R U_L U_R U_L (four-operator products)

### 7.2 Commutation Properties

In the representation:

**Non-commutation at depth two (CS3, CS5):**
```
⟨Ω|[U_L U_R, U_R U_L]|Ω⟩ ≠ 0
```

but this non-commutation is not absolute (the commutator itself is non-zero but not proportional to identity).

**Commutation at depth four (CS7):**
```
⟨Ω|U_L U_R U_L U_R|Ω⟩ = ⟨Ω|U_R U_L U_R U_L|Ω⟩
```

This is absolute in the cyclic sector.

## 8. Verification of CGM Axioms

### 8.1 Axiom CS7 (Balance)

In the Hilbert space representation:

```
|| (U_L U_R U_L U_R - U_R U_L U_R U_L) |Ω⟩ || = 0
```

This means the two four-step evolutions produce the same state when acting on the cyclic vector, implementing □B.

### 8.2 Axiom CS1 (Right Preservation)

```
⟨Ω|U_R|Ω⟩ = ⟨Ω|I|Ω⟩ = 1
```

The right unitary preserves the expectation value of the cyclic state.

### 8.3 Axiom CS2 (Left Alteration)

```
⟨Ω|U_L|Ω⟩ = e^(iθ_L) ≠ 1
```

The left unitary introduces a non-trivial phase, implementing chirality.

## 9. Completeness and Spectral Properties

### 9.1 Hilbert Space Completeness

The GNS construction guarantees H_ω is complete in the norm induced by the inner product. Every Cauchy sequence in H_ω converges to an element of H_ω.

### 9.2 Spectral Theorem

Since U_L and U_R are unitary, they are normal operators. The spectral theorem applies:

```
U_L = ∫_{S¹} e^(iθ) dE_L(θ)
U_R = ∫_{S¹} e^(iθ) dE_R(θ)
```

where E_L and E_R are projection-valued measures on the circle S¹.

### 9.3 Joint Spectrum

The joint spectrum of (U_L, U_R) encodes the complete modal structure. The balance condition CS7 constrains this joint spectrum, requiring:

```
σ(U_L U_R U_L U_R) = σ(U_R U_L U_R U_L)
```

in the cyclic sector.

## 10. Connection to Physical Hilbert Spaces

### 10.1 Quantum Mechanical Interpretation

In standard quantum mechanics:
- States are vectors in a Hilbert space
- Observables are self-adjoint operators
- Time evolution is by unitary operators

The CGM representation provides all three:
- States: vectors in H_ω
- Observables: the metrics T, V, A, B (all self-adjoint)
- Evolution: composition of U_L and U_R (both unitary)

### 10.2 Angular Momentum

The SU(2) structure at UNA corresponds to spin angular momentum in quantum mechanics. The three generators J₁, J₂, J₃ satisfying [J_i, J_j] = iε_{ijk} J_k emerge from the Lie algebra of U_L and U_R when restricted to the rotational sector.

### 10.3 Phase Space

The 6-dimensional phase space at ONA corresponds to the classical limit, with:
- 3 position coordinates from R³ (translations)
- 3 momentum coordinates from the conjugate momenta

The Hilbert space H_ω is L²(R³), the space of square-integrable functions on position space.

## 11. Time Evolution and Stone's Theorem

### 11.1 One-Parameter Unitary Group

Define a continuous family of unitaries:

```
U(t) = exp(i t H)
```

where H is a self-adjoint operator (the Hamiltonian).

### 11.2 Stone's Theorem

Stone's theorem guarantees that any strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group has a unique self-adjoint generator:

```
U(t) = e^{itH}  ⟺  H self-adjoint
```

In CGM, the logical progression CS → UNA → ONA → BU induces a discrete sequence. For continuous time evolution, we can extend this to a continuous parameter t with H generating the evolution.

### 11.3 Correspondence

The discrete modal transitions [L] and [R] correspond to specific values of t:
- U_L = U(t_L) for some t_L
- U_R = U(t_R) for some t_R

The logical dependency chain in the proof sequence determines the ordering t_CS < t_UNA < t_ONA < t_BU.

## 12. Explicit Construction on L²(S²)

### 12.1 Hilbert Space

H = L²(S², dΩ) consists of square-integrable functions f: S² → C with inner product:

```
⟨f, g⟩ = (1/4π) ∫_{S²} f̄(ω) g(ω) dΩ
```

The normalization 1/(4π) implements Q_G = 4π.

### 12.2 Rotation Actions

Choose specific rotations:
- R_L: rotation by angle θ_L about the z-axis (implementing left chirality)
- R_R: rotation by angle θ_R about a different axis (implementing right action)

Then:
```
(U_L f)(ω) = f(R_L^{-1} ω)
(U_R f)(ω) = f(R_R^{-1} ω)
```

### 12.3 Cyclic Vector

The constant function |Ω⟩(ω) = 1 serves as the cyclic vector:

```
⟨Ω|Ω⟩ = (1/4π) ∫_{S²} 1 dΩ = (1/4π) · 4π = 1
```

### 12.4 Verification of Unitarity

For any rotation R:

```
⟨URf, URg⟩ = (1/4π) ∫_{S²} f̄(R^{-1}ω) g(R^{-1}ω) dΩ
            = (1/4π) ∫_{S²} f̄(ω') g(ω') dΩ'    [change of variables]
            = ⟨f, g⟩
```

Therefore U_L and U_R are unitary.

## 13. Modal Depth and Commutativity

### 13.1 Depth-Two Commutator

The commutator of U_L and U_R is:

```
[U_L, U_R] = U_L U_R - U_R U_L
```

This is generally non-zero, implementing CS1 and CS2.

### 13.2 Depth-Four Equality

The balance condition becomes:

```
|| (U_L U_R U_L U_R - U_R U_L U_R U_L) |Ω⟩ || = 0
```

This can be satisfied by choosing R_L and R_R such that the four-fold compositions agree on the constant function sector, while still having [U_L, U_R] ≠ 0 on the full space.

## 14. Observables and Measurement

### 14.1 Position and Momentum

On L²(R³), standard position and momentum operators are:

```
(X_i ψ)(x) = x_i ψ(x)
(P_i ψ)(x) = -i ∂_i ψ(x)
```

These are self-adjoint and satisfy [X_i, P_j] = iδ_{ij}.

### 14.2 CGM Observable Algebra

The CGM observables form a commutative *-subalgebra of B(H):

```
A_CGM = span{T, V, A, B}
```

where T, V, A, B are the four metrics defined in Section 6.

### 14.3 Spectral Decomposition

Each observable O ∈ A_CGM has spectral decomposition:

```
O = ∫ λ dE_O(λ)
```

where E_O is a projection-valued measure. Measurement outcomes are eigenvalues λ with probabilities given by Born's rule.

## 15. Consistency Verification

### 15.1 Norm Preservation

Verify that the representation preserves norms:

```
|| π_ω(a) || = sup_{||ψ||=1} || π_ω(a) ψ ||
```

This ensures the Hilbert space structure is compatible with the algebraic structure.

### 15.2 Positivity

Verify that ω is positive:

```
ω(a*a) ≥ 0  for all a ∈ A
```

This is satisfied by construction for any state functional on a *-algebra.

### 15.3 Cyclic Property

Verify that |Ω⟩ is cyclic:

```
{π_ω(a)|Ω⟩ : a ∈ A} is dense in H_ω
```

This ensures the representation captures all of A.

## 16. Numerical Implementation

The concrete sphere model H = L²(S²) can be numerically implemented using:

1. **Discretization:** Approximate S² by a finite grid (e.g., 64×128 in (θ, φ) coordinates)
2. **Quadrature:** Use Gaussian quadrature for the integral ∫_{S²} dΩ
3. **Matrix representation:** U_L and U_R become finite-dimensional unitary matrices
4. **Eigenvalue computation:** Standard numerical linear algebra for spectra

A Python implementation demonstrating:
- Construction of the discrete Hilbert space
- Verification of unitarity for U_L, U_R
- Computation of commutators at depths 2 and 4
- Spectral analysis of observables

is provided in the companion code `experiments/cgm_Hilbert_Space_analysis.py`.

## 17. Extensions and Open Questions

### 17.1 Infinite-Dimensional Limit

The discrete model can be taken to the continuum limit as the grid is refined. The GNS construction guarantees the existence of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space in the limit.

### 17.2 Separability

The Hilbert space H = L²(S², dΩ) is separable (has a countable orthonormal basis, e.g., spherical harmonics Y_ℓm). This is standard for quantum systems.

### 17.3 Representations Beyond L²(S²)

Other representations are possible:
- L²(R³) for the translational sector at ONA
- Tensor products L²(S²) ⊗ L²(R³) for the full SE(3) structure
- Fock spaces for multi-particle systems

All arise from the same algebraic structure through different choices of ω.

## 18. Conclusion

We have constructed an explicit Hilbert space representation of the Common Governance Model using the standard GNS construction. The key results:

1. **Existence:** The CGM axioms admit a Hilbert space representation where [L] and [R] act as unitary operators
2. **Concreteness:** The representation can be realized explicitly as L²(S², dΩ) with Q_G = 4π
3. **Observables:** The CGM metrics correspond to self-adjoint operators with well-defined spectra
4. **Completeness:** The Hilbert space is complete, ensuring all quantum mechanical requirements are satisfied
5. **Consistency:** The axioms CS1–CS7 are faithfully represented through operator relations and cyclic vector constraints

The Common Governance Model has a rigorous quantum mechanical formulation. The modal operators generate an algebra of observables on a Hilbert space, with the horizon constant Q_G = 4π serving as the natural normalization. The construction shows that CGM provides both a Hilbert-style axiomatization of physics (logical structure) and a Hilbert-space representation (quantum mechanical structure), fulfilling Hilbert's sixth problem in both senses.
