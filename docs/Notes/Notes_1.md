- Recursive Definitions of Singularity, Infinity, Gravity, and Geometry in CGM
    
    ## 0. Scope and conventions
    
    We work in a single Einstein–Ungar gyrovector space (V,  ⊕,  ⊖,  gyr)(V,\;\oplus,\;\ominus,\;\mathrm{gyr}) with speed parameter cc. Gyroaddition is ⊕\oplus. Coaddition (used only at BU) is ⊞\boxplus. The gyration gyr[a,b]\mathrm{gyr}[a,b] is an automorphism encoding ordered-composition memory:
    
    a⊕(b⊕c)=(a⊕b)⊕gyr[a,b]c,gyr[a,b]c=⊖(a⊕b)⊕(a⊕(b⊕c)).a\oplus(b\oplus c)=(a\oplus b)\oplus \mathrm{gyr}[a,b]c,\qquad 
    \mathrm{gyr}[a,b]c=\ominus(a\oplus b)\oplus\bigl(a\oplus(b\oplus c)\bigr).
    
    The gyrotriangle defect is
    
    δ=π−(α+β+γ).\delta=\pi-(\alpha+\beta+\gamma).
    
    Angles at the four checkpoints are fixed by CGM thresholds:
    
    α=π2(CS),β=π4(UNA),γ=π4(ONA),δ=0(BU).\alpha=\frac{\pi}{2}\quad(\text{CS}),\qquad
    \beta=\frac{\pi}{4}\quad(\text{UNA}),\qquad
    \gamma=\frac{\pi}{4}\quad(\text{ONA}),\qquad
    \delta=0\quad(\text{BU}).
    
    Left gyration carries the primordial asymmetry. Identity placement follows the left-identity convention: e⊕a=ae\oplus a=a.
    
    ## 1. Axiom and stage theorems
    
    1. **Axiom (CS – The Source is Common).** Left gyration is non-identity and right gyration identity. Chirality is primitive and unobservable directly; only its consequences are observable. Minimal phase: α=π/2\alpha=\pi/2.
    2. **First Theorem (UNA – Unity is Non-Absolute).** Right gyration activates, left gyration persists. Minimal phase split β=π/4\beta=\pi/4 yields three orthogonal spin axes (SU(2) frame). Observable distinction appears but remains chiral.
    3. **Second Theorem (ONA – Opposition is Non-Absolute).** Both gyrations are maximally non-identity. A further γ=π/4\gamma=\pi/4 generates three translational parameters consistent with bi-gyroassociativity. Full non-associative regime: 6 DoF.
    4. **Third Theorem (BU – Balance is Universal).** Both gyrations return to identity; non-associativity cancels globally while the algebraic memory of the path is preserved. Closure requires δ=0\delta=0 and fixes the amplitude threshold
    
    A2(2π)L(2π)R=π2  ⇒  A=122π=:mp.A^2(2\pi)_L(2\pi)_R=\frac{\pi}{2}\;\Rightarrow\; A=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2\pi}}=:m_p.
    
    ## 2. Time as recursive memory
    
    **Definition (Temporal emergence).** Time is the ordered record of recursive composition encoded by gyration. Where gyr≠I\mathrm{gyr}\neq I, order matters and temporal memory accumulates; at BU, gyr=I\mathrm{gyr}=I and the memory is fully encoded. No external temporal parameter is assumed.
    
    **Operational measure.** For a recursive path ℓ\ell,
    
    τobs=∫ℓ∇arg⁡(ψrec) dℓ,\tau_{\text{obs}}=\int_\ell \nabla \arg(\psi_{\text{rec}})\,d\ell,
    
    with ψrec\psi_{\text{rec}} the coherence field representing accumulated recursion. “Flow” is maximal near ONA (peak non-associativity) and saturates at BU.
    
    ## 3. Spatial dimensionality and DoF
    
    **Proposition (3D with six DoF).** The sequence (α,β,γ)=(π/2,π/4,π/4)(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)=(\pi/2,\pi/4,\pi/4) with δ=0\delta=0 is the unique minimal partition of the observable π\pi-horizon that closes the gyrotriangle with degenerate sides, stabilising:
    
    - three rotational DoF (UNA; SU(2)L_L≅\congSO(3)),
    - three translational DoF (ONA; SU(2)R_R activation),
    - six total DoF stabilised at BU.
    
    **Rationale.** Smaller phases fail recursive closure; higher dimensions lack a closed, defect-free pattern under the prescribed gyration sequence. The left-to-right activation order preserves the primordial left bias.
    
    ## 4. Parity and the sign structure
    
    **Lemma (Defect asymmetry).** The positive sequence (+π/2,+π/4,+π/4)(+\pi/2,+\pi/4,+\pi/4) yields δ=0\delta=0. The negative sequence accumulates a 2π2\pi defect. Only the left-initiated path is defect-free within one π\pi observational horizon.
    
    ## 5. Closure, topology, and memory
    
    **Theorem (BU closure).** At BU, lgyr=rgyr=I\mathrm{lgyr}=\mathrm{rgyr}=I and coaddition
    
    a⊞b:=a⊕gyr[a,⊖b]ba\boxplus b := a\oplus \mathrm{gyr}[a,\ominus b]b
    
    is commutative and associative on the stabilised configuration space. The latent angular memories (2π)L(2\pi)_L and (2π)R(2\pi)_R remain as algebraic memory. The global topology realises as S3×S3S^3\times S^3 (rotational and translational memories).
    
    ## 6. Doctrinal definitions
    
    1. **Infinity (recursive).** Not unbounded extent, but loss of further resolution due to phase-gradient flattening:
    
    lim⁡ℓ→ℓ∗∥∇arg⁡(ψrec)∥→0.\lim_{\ell\to \ell^*}\|\nabla \arg(\psi_{\text{rec}})\| \to 0.
    
    Beyond the saturation depth ℓ∗\ell^*, additional distinction is epistemically inaccessible.
    
    1. **Singularity (recursive).** A fold where recursive curvature fails to propagate (memory cannot store torsion):
    
    ∥μ(Mℓ)∥→∞butψrec(ℓ)→0,\|\mu(M_\ell)\|\to \infty\quad\text{but}\quad \psi_{\text{rec}}(\ell)\to 0,
    
    with μ(M)\mu(M) the monodromy (ordered product of gyrations) around a loop MM.
    
    1. **Gravity (as monodromy).** The gravitational field is the spatial gradient of residual coherence failure:
    
    G(x):=∇ arg⁡ ⁣[∏i∈N(x)gyr[ai,bi]].\mathcal{G}(x) := \nabla\,\arg\!\left[\prod_{i\in N(x)} \mathrm{gyr}[a_i,b_i]\right].
    
    Where μ(M)=I\mu(M)=I, recursion closes and gravity vanishes; where μ(M)≠I\mu(M)\neq I, stored twist remains and produces curvature.
    
    1. **Roundness of equilibrated bodies.** In the absence of net torsion, recursive memory minimisation yields isotropic coherence (sphere). Spin-induced coherence deforms to an oblate figure.
    
    ## 7. Physical constants as threshold diagnostics
    
    Fix small, instrument-calibrated tolerances and derive:
    
    - **Speed of light cc**: the minimal vv for which a spin degree of freedom resists trivialisation via the loop property (UNA onset).
    - **Planck’s constant ℏ\hbar**: minimal non-associative residue ∥AssocDef∥\|\text{AssocDef}\| times a reference length Δℓ\Delta\ell at ONA.
    - **Newton’s constant GG**: inverse proportional to coarse-grained closure energy density ρclosure\rho_{\text{closure}} at BU.
    - **Higgs mass scale**: minimal loop where ∥μ(loop)−I∥\|\mu(\text{loop})-I\| exceeds a fixed threshold, mapped to an energy scale.
    
    Once these tolerances are fixed against laboratory values, subsequent CGM predictions acquire dimensions without further free parameters.
    
    ## 8. Testable and computational statements
    
    1. **Threshold uniqueness (local).** Under stage ordering α≥β≥γ\alpha\ge\beta\ge\gamma, δ=0\delta=0, the only degenerate-side solution in a neighbourhood is (π/2,π/4,π/4)(\pi/2,\pi/4,\pi/4). Numerical searches confirm local uniqueness to machine precision.
    2. **Left-bias prediction.** Any attempted right-precedence construction incurs a 2π2\pi defect inside one π\pi observational horizon.
    3. **Wave/curvature correspondence.** Gravitational radiation encodes the time-derivative of monodromy release; polarisation histories track recursive memory reorganisation.
    4. **CMB chirality signature (speculative but falsifiable).** Polarisation patterns should reflect the CS chirality that initiates UNA.
