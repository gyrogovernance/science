Staffod Beers Team Syntegrity has ceratain roles. While most are part of logistics - so not actual part of the topology, there are two I guess that are left as part of the underlying "physics" - these are the participant and the critic if I am not mistaken. 

But I have an issue with criticism - I feel it permeates tensions instead of netutralising them because it focuses on criticism and crisis - this is a bias which derives from observation itself. I am not an expert in cognition or statistical significance and measurement from a scientific perspective, but you are and you can help me explain what I want to convey here. I think there is only one role, but topology creates tensions. For example if we say opposition - it will always remain opposed keeping the tension. What Tensegrity says about this? There is a fact about stability and equilibria which we miss. In fact there should be 3 roles, 2 of which are probably relative to my theorems. The one about unity non absolute (UNA node) and the other about opposition non absolute (ONA node), the third about Balance universal (BU node) is intelligence itself, not an individual. 

This query is important because in information and alignment consensus infosets - lets say an AI model behavior evaluation suite - we have roles which bring unecessary biases - for example a judge (another inapropriate role for a critic) or a scorer which again is not right, and then a user which is a term I am totally against it (use of what?).
