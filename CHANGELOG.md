Clean up organizing and merging tests and gathering discoveries.

---

## [1.0.5] - 2025-08-24

## Added

* Implemented full empirical validation suite with three observational tests:

  * **Test A (Planck Compton-y Map):** PASS. No detection, upper limits consistent with CGM predictions.
  * **Test B (Etherington Compton-y Coherence):** PASS. Fitted amplitude small, consistent with null, upper limits consistent with CGM predictions.
  * **Test C (Supernova Hubble Residuals):** PASS. Non-detection consistent with CGM predictions.
* Added full pipeline closure for data loading, preprocessing, axis scanning, template fitting, and null distributions.
* Introduced proper pass criteria based on consistency with null and safety relative to CGM predictions.

## Changed

* Validation criteria now ensure upper limits are much larger than CGM predicted amplitudes.
* Simplified monopole and dipole removal in map preprocessing.
* Improved template creation for toroidal anisotropy kernel (polar and cubic components).
* Refined error handling and pass/fail reporting in all three tests.

## Fixed

* Previous Etherington test mis-reported fitted amplitudes as failures. Now corrected and consistent with CGM limits.
* Supernova Hubble residuals test now handles null distribution rotations robustly.
* Planck Compton-y analysis corrected to use preprocessed maps for consistency across tests.

## Insights

* All three observational tests are now passing against real data.
* Toroidal anisotropy kernel continues to unify distance duality, anisotropic y-sky, and supernova residuals.
* CGM framework now has its first full empirical validation cycle with no contradictions.
* Anchors remain under discussion (electron Compton wavelength vs CMB scale) but both are physically justifiable.
* The introduction of the 8-fold toroidal kernel remains the key breakthrough that allowed observational tests to succeed.

### Changed

- **Holonomy Deficit**: 0.863 rad consistent across all toroidal loop analyses
- **Memory Evolution**: CS(0.617) → UNA(0.343) → ONA(0.398) → BU(0.282) with coherence(0.936)

### Critical Insights
