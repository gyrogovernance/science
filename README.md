## Introduction
    
The Common Governance Model (CGM) presents an axiomatic framework for understanding how structure emerges through recursive alignment. As an axiomatic model, CGM begins from a single foundational principle and derives all subsequent structure through logical necessity. Each theorem follows inevitably from the axiom, with nothing assumed and everything emerging through recursive self-reference.
    
The model demonstrates that three-dimensional space with six degrees of freedom is not an assumption but a logical derivation. Time appears as the sequential ordering of recursive operations, encoded by gyration's memory of operation order. The mathematical formalism employs gyrogroup and bi-gyrogroup structures following Abraham Ungar's work, providing precise language for tracking transitions from undifferentiated potential to fully structured reality.

Recent developments have extended CGM to define quantum gravity as the geometric invariant Q_G = 4π, representing the complete solid angle required for coherent observation. This framework derives fundamental physical constants from pure geometric principles, including the fine-structure constant α to experimental precision (0.043 ppb) and predicts characteristic energy scales through recursive polygon methods. The unified picture reveals physics as the necessary geometry for self-coherent observation.
