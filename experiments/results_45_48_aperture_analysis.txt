45° TO 48° APERTURE TRANSITION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

ANGULAR TRANSITION ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
45° = 45.0° = 0.785398 rad
48° = 48.0° = 0.837758 rad
Difference = 3.0° = 0.052360 rad
Percentage increase = 6.67%

CLOSURE ANALYSIS:
--------------------
45° closure = 50.00% (perfect square)
48° closure = 53.33% (aperture square)
Aperture = 3.33%

FRACTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS:
------------------------------
48°/45° = 1.066667
Exact fraction = 16/15
Musical interval = Major Second (Semitone)
Frequency ratio = 1.066667

CGM APERTURE COMPARISON:
------------------------------
CGM aperture = 2.07%
CGM closure = 97.93%
45°→48° aperture = 3.33%
45°→48° closure = 96.67%
Aperture ratio (CGM/45°→48°) = 0.621

GEOMETRIC SIGNIFICANCE:
-------------------------
45° = π/4 (perfect square)
48° = 4π/15 (aperture square)
Difference = 0.016667π
Perfect closure: 4 × 45° = 180° (perfect square)
Aperture closure: 4 × 48° = 192° (aperture square)
Total aperture gap: 192° - 180° = 12° total aperture

THEORETICAL CONNECTION:
-------------------------
Both represent closure with aperture: True
CGM aperture purpose: Allows observation while maintaining structure
Angle aperture purpose: Allows geometric flexibility while maintaining closure
Common principle: Incomplete closure enables dynamic observation

CLOSURE PRINCIPLES:
--------------------
Perfect Closure: Complete geometric closure (45°, 90°, etc.)
Aperture Closure: Incomplete closure with intentional gap (48°, etc.)
Cgm Closure: Structural closure with observational aperture (2.07%)
Common Theme: All represent different levels of geometric completeness
